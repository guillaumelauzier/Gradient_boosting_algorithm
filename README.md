# Gradient_boosting_algorithm

Gradient boosting is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong predictive model. It works by training weak learners on subsets of the data, and then adding them together to make a final prediction. This is done by fitting the weak learners to the residual errors of the previous learner, so that each subsequent learner focuses on the mistakes of the previous one. By iteratively training the weak learners in this way, the gradient boosting algorithm can create a highly accurate model.

This is just an example, and there are many different ways to implement a gradient boosting algorithm. This code is not complete and will not compile as-is. It is up to you to write the code for the buildGradientBoostingModel and classify functions to make it work properly.
